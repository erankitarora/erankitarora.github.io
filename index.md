Hi! I am Ankit Arora.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at IBM. I have completed my M.Tech in Information technology at IIIT Bangalore in the year 2016. I have done my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering and graduated in the year 2014.
I wanted to learn more about software, because it has revolutionized every space in the industry with its power. Most of the software tools are open source and also free to use. So, the possibilities are endless with IT.

You can find my projects on Github after going to my github profile.
